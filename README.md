# BT5153 Group Project (Group 9) - Airbnb Smart Scan
This is the Github repository for Group 9 Final Project for BT5153 Class Semester 2 2022. <br>

To clarify the codes submitted, below are the details: <br>
<h4> Codes listed in the folder 'preprocessing_models_and_recommender_system':</h4><br>
-  <strong> File Name: </strong>content_based_recommendation.ipynb <br>
<strong> Packages used:</strong> pandas, numpy, sklearn, preprocessing (see file description below) <br>
<strong> Description: </strong><br>
This file returns top 10 most similar listings to a particular listing. Before running the recommendation algorithm, a few key steps was done: <br>
(1) Merge Data & Feature Engineering: listing data was merged with host-related and property-related engineered features, sentiment and location data.<br> 
(2) Feature Selection: Relevant features were selected.<br>
(3) Preprocessing & Normalisation: Features were preprocessed and normalised so that cosine similarity calculation can be done<br>
(4) Recommendation Results: The normalized features were done used to compute similarity matrix and top 10 listings which had the highest similarity to a listing will be returned. <br><br>

- <strong> File Name: </strong>preprocessing.py <br>
<strong> Packages used:</strong> pandas, numpy, re, collections, ast <br>
<strong> Description: </strong><br>
This file contains functions to preprocess dataframes, which included drop unused features, remove inactive listings, expand features, imputation, log-transform skewed columns, Winsorization, one hot key encoding. It also contains a function which expanded amenities features. This preprocessing file was imported and used in the content_based_recommendation.ipynb and in the models.ipynb. <br><br>

-  <strong> File Name: </strong>models.ipynb <br>
<strong> Packages used:</strong> pandas, seaborn, numpy, matplotlib, sklearn, lightgbm, xgboost, miceforest, keras, shap, tensorflow <br>
<strong> Description: </strong><br>
This file contains all of the regression models and some EDA.
Prior to training and running the models, the following steps were implemented:<br>
(1) Merging all data (sentiments, listings, engineered features and location data)<br>
(2) Data preprocessing steps, including MICE imputation, feature selection, one hot key encoding, scaling and more.<br>
Models run and tuned were: LightGBM, XGBoost, Simple OLS, Random Forest and Stacked Regressors.

<h4> Codes listed in the folder 'eda_and_feature_engineering':<br></h4>
- <strong> File Name: </strong>eda.ipynb <br>
<strong> Packages used:</strong> pandas, seaborn, numpy, matplotlib <br>
<strong> Description: </strong><br>
This file contains some of the graphs used in the report. <br><br>

- <strong> File Name: </strong>london_nearest_tube.ipynb <br>
<strong> Packages used:</strong> pandas, numpy, geopy <br>
<strong> Description: </strong><br>
Merge listings dataset with London stations dataset so that for each listing, there are 3 new features included, nearest stations to listing, listing’s distance to nearest station and listing’s walking distance to station.<br><br>

- <strong> File Name: </strong> sentiment_analysis.ipynb <br>
<strong> Packages used:</strong> VADER, texthero, nltk, pandarallel, pandas, numpy <br>
<strong> Description: </strong><br>
This notebook does sentiment analysis of the listing reviews files.<br>
The input is the reviews which were pre-processed with VADER to do lemmatization without cleaning.<br>
The sentiment analysis done was polarity scores of the reviews, which are then grouped into either Positive, Negative or Neutral sentiments. Reviews which were not in English were dropped.<br>
